# Eyes Classification
A CNN-based model leveraging ResNet50V2 to classify images as showing visible or closed eyes, trained with data augmentation and fine-tuning.

## Description
This project involves developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using ResNet50V2 to classify images into two categories: eyes visible or eyes closed. The dataset consists of 400 labeled images (200 for each class), augmented to improve generalization. The model was trained and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, demonstrating strong performance with a balanced evaluation across classes.
